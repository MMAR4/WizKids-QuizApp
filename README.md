## Available Scripts

### `npm start`  
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page reloads automatically when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`  
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
For more details, see the section about running tests.

### `npm run build`  
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
Bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The build output is minified, and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`  
**Warning: This is a one-way operation.**  
Ejecting will copy all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control.  
After ejecting, you can customize the build process, but you canâ€™t go back to the original setup.  
Use this only if you need advanced configuration beyond the default setup.
